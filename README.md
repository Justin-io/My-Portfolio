# Advanced AI & Security Portfolio

This repository hosts the source code for a highly interactive, agentic portfolio website. It showcases advanced frontend engineering, bridging the gap between artistic design and complex logic.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Autonomous AI Agent ("Justin's Digital Twin")**: A context-aware chatbot that guides users, provides first-person summaries, and answers questions using predefined logic.
- **Interactive Walkthrough Mode**: An automated, scroll-driven tour of the portfolio with a custom "Presentation Mode" avatar (`explain.png`), real-time commentary, and glassmorphic user controls (Pause/Resume/Stop).
- **Dynamic Glitch Animations**: Custom CSS/JS animations for Hero images and AI entrance effects, creating a distinct "Cyberpunk/SecOps" aesthetic.
- **Smart State Management**: Complex logic for handling interactions between the Intersection Observer, AI Chat, and Walkthrough modes to ensure a seamless user experience.
