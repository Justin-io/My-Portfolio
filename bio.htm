                <h2 class="chapter-title">The Spark of Curiosity</h2>
                <div class="quote-block">
                    "I want him to be a force of good in this world."
                </div>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    I was born in Kadalundi on April 7, 2005, a timeline still rippling with the aftershocks of the
                    massive tsunami that had devastated our coast just months prior. My beginnings were humble—my father
                    drove an auto-rickshaw, and my mother managed our home. Yet, in that simplicity, I found my first
                    classroom.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    They tell me I was an intense child. While other babies slept, I would lie awake, staring at the
                    spinning ceiling fan for hours, mesmerized not just by the motion, but seemingly trying to decode
                    the mechanism behind it. By nine months, I had bypassed crawling to flip through magazines, my eyes
                    scanning pages with a focus that often unsettled our neighbors. It wasn't just attention; it was a
                    hunger. I didn't know the words yet, but I knew I wanted to understand how the world worked.
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapter-title">The "Problem Child"</h2>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    My parents invested everything they had to send me to St. Mary's, a local CBSE school, believing
                    English education was my ticket out. Academically, I thrived. I was reading far above my grade level
                    and constantly raising my hand. But my social education was far rockier. I had a quick temper and a
                    fierce, almost naive sense of justice. If I saw a bigger kid pushing a smaller one, I didn't call a
                    teacher; I threw the first punch.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    I became known as a paradox—the student who corrected teachers on planetary motion yet spent half
                    his time standing outside the class for bad behavior. I once interrupted a lecture to argue that the
                    textbook's explanation of gravity was oversimplified. I wasn't trying to be rude; I genuinely
                    couldn't handle the inaccuracy. But to my teachers, I was just disruptive. By age nine, the friction
                    was too much. I was transferred to a government school. To everyone else, it looked like a failure.
                    To me, it felt like the end of the world.
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapter-title">The "Tadpole" Era</h2>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    The government school was a culture shock. The benches were broken, the uniforms faded, and I was
                    the "stuck-up CBSE boy." I struggled to fit in. I knew facts, but I didn't know life.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    The defining moment came on a rainy afternoon. A group of boys were gathered around a puddle, poking
                    at small, swimming creatures. I walked over and genuinely asked, "What are those small fish?" The
                    playground erupted in laughter. "The genius doesn't know what a tadpole is!" they jeered. I knew the
                    biological lifecycle of a frog, I could draw it, label it—but I had never actually *seen* one.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    The name "Tadpole" stuck. It became a label for my naivety. I was bullied, mocked, and isolated.
                    Even teachers dismissed me, removing me from quiz teams I was qualified for because they said I
                    lacked "real understanding." It was humiliating, but it was also necessary. It forced me to stop
                    memorizing and start observing. I realized that knowing the name of something is not the same as
                    knowing it.

                <h2 class="chapter-title">Rejection & The Dark Path</h2>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    In 7th grade, seeking validation, I gathered the courage to propose to the class topper. I thought
                    my grades would impress her. Her rejection was surgical. She didn't just say no; she dismantled me.
                    "You have no identity," she said. "You're just 'Tadpole'. You have no talent, no future. Why would I
                    choose you?"
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    That night, I didn't cry. I burned with a need to prove her wrong. I studied furiously, expecting to
                    top the finals and shove my report card in her face. Instead, I failed. I crashed and burned.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    broken and adrift, I found a new world: the internet. It started innocently—video games, forums. But
                    soon, I discovered "text bombing"—crashing WhatsApp with malicious code. It gave me a rush of power.
                    When a stranger hacked my mother's phone, instead of fear, I felt awe. *How did he do that?* I
                    borrowed a phone for one hour a day, filling notebook after notebook with handwritten code, teaching
                    myself cybersecurity. The "Tadpole" was growing legs.

                <h2 class="chapter-title">The Abyss</h2>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    The 2018 floods were a tragedy for Kerala, but for me, they brought a strange gift: a discarded,
                    water-damaged Nokia phone. I dried it out, fixed it, and it became my weapon. It was slow, so I
                    hacked the OS, stripping it down to the kernel to make it fly.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    But power without a moral compass is dangerous. I started hacking for sport. I spied on classmates,
                    accessed private chats, and felt like a god. When a rival threatened me, I didn't fight back with
                    fists; I destroyed his digital reputation. I exposed his secrets. I felt triumphant until his mother
                    called me, sobbing, begging me to stop.
                </p>
                <div class="quote-block">
                    "Hearing a mother cry because of my code... that was the moment the illusion shattered. I wasn't a
                    genius. I was a bully with a keyboard."
                </div>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    I confessed. I deleted everything. I swore to never use my skills for harm again. I channeled my
                    energy into **Texido Meg**, a free blog where I taught ethical hacking, helping thousands of others
                    learn to protect themselves. I helped my teachers secure their online classes during the pandemic.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    But redemption isn't a straight line. Impatient to see my exam results, I breached a government
                    server. I changed nothing, just looked. But I was caught. The Cybercell police visited my home. They
                    didn't arrest me, but the shame was worse than handcuffs. My father, in a mix of terrified rage and
                    protection, gathered every electronic device I owned—my phone, my cables, my hard drives—and burned
                    them in the front yard. I watched my digital life turn to ash and smoke.

                <h2 class="chapter-title">Rising from the Ashes</h2>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    For two years, I touched no computer. I focused on my books. I joined a tuition center where nobody
                    knew "Tadpole." I was just Hari. But when I overheard the administration struggling with their
                    student management system, I couldn't help myself. I tentatively offered to help.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    I worked from internet cafes. I built them a robust, full-stack web portal. On launch day, the
                    director called me on stage. He didn't introduce me as a "problem child." He introduced me as a
                    genius. The applause washed over me. And there, in the front row, clapping with genuine respect, was
                    *her*—the girl who had rejected me years ago. I realized then that I didn't need to prove anything
                    to her anymore. I had proven it to myself.

                <h2 class="chapter-title">The Triumph of Purpose</h2>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    Today, I stand at IES College of Engineering, not as a hacker, but as a creator. My project,
                    **Q-SAFE**, isn't just code; it's a quantum-inspired shield designed to protect people from the very
                    vulnerabilities I once exploited.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    My platforms—**Texido Meg**, **ShopRoyince**, and the **HOPE Platform**—are built on a simple
                    premise: technology should empower, not destroy. I am researching the **Chronon-Super Quantum Level
                    Model** because knowing *how* the universe works is still that same hunger I had as a baby staring
                    at the fan.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    The name "Tadpole" was meant to hurt me, but I wear it as a badge of honor now. A tadpole is purely
                    potential. It struggles in muddy water, it changes, it grows legs, and eventually, it steps onto
                    land. I have stepped onto land. And I am just getting started.
