                <div class="quote-block">
                    "I want to be a force of good in this world."
                </div>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    Born in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami in Kadalundi, my life began with a name that means "the
                    one who takes away evil." From the very beginning, I was different. While other infants slept, I
                    would stare at the ceiling fan with unwavering focus, my mind already trying to decode the physics
                    of the world around me. By nine months, I wasn't just crawling; I was flipping through magazines
                    with the seriousness of a scholar. My curiosity wasn't just a trait; it was an innate drive, a
                    prelude to a mind that would one day question the very fabric of existence.

                <h2 class="chapter-title">The Early Years</h2>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    My early education began at a CBSE school, where my brilliance shone early. I was reading before my
                    peers and questioning everything even correcting adults on planetary motion. But my intelligence
                    came with a fiery temperament. When I perceived injustice, I reacted with force. Despite behavioral
                    challenges, my academic prowess was undeniable, even securing a national rank in a talent search
                    examination. However, escalating conflicts led to a pivotal decision by age nine: a transfer to the
                    local government school. It looked like a step down, but in truth, it was the first step into a
                    crucible that would forge my character.

                <h2 class="chapter-title">The "Tadpole" Era</h2>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    The transition to government school was brutal. The label of "CBSE boy" made me an outsider. When I
                    innocently asked what tadpoles were having never seen them in real life despite knowing the theory I
                    was mocked and branded "Tadpole." The nickname stuck. To make matters worse, my knowledge was
                    dismissed as mere memorization. I was publicly humiliated, removed from a quiz team I was qualified
                    for, and told I lacked "understanding."
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    Yet, in this isolation, I found a friend who saw my true potential. And I found a silent rival a
                    brilliant classmate who challenged me to understand *why* things happen, not just *what* happens.
                    Slowly, my arrogance was humbled, replaced by a hunger for deep, genuine understanding.

                <h2 class="chapter-title">Humiliation and Awakening</h2>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    In 7th grade, I faced a crushing rejection. A classmate didn't just reject my proposal; she
                    dissected my lack of an identity. "You're known as 'Tadpole'... You have no particular talent... Why
                    should I say yes to someone like you?"
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    Devastated but driven, I vowed to outshine her. I studied furiously, only to fail my exams
                    miserably. I hit rock bottom. In this dark period, I stumbled upon the world of digital power. I
                    joined online groups, learned about "text bombs" that crashed phones, and began exploring the darker
                    corners of the internet.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    A hack on my mother's phone changed everything. Instead of fear, I felt curiosity. I began teaching
                    myself cybersecurity using a borrowed phone for just one hour a day, filling notebooks with raw code
                    and theory. The "Tadpole" was evolving into a hacker.

                <p class="chapter-text">
                    The 2018 floods brought destruction but also a gift: an old, low-spec phone. I didn't just use it; I
                    surgically replaced its operating system with my own custom, cloud-based OS to bypass its hardware
                    limits. I was now powerful. But power corrupted. I hacked neighbors, spied on classmates, and in a
                    fit of rage, digitally destroyed a rival who threatened me.
                </p>
                <div class="quote-block">
                    "I had become like a monkey with a gun holding immense power without the wisdom to use it."

                <p class="chapter-text">
                    The plea of a mother broke me. Realizing the monster I was becoming, I confessed to my friend and
                    deleted everything. I sought redemption through **Texido Meg**, a free educational platform where I
                    shared my cybersecurity knowledge with thousands. I became a guardian, not a predator.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter-text">
                    My skills grew. During the lockdown, I traced an intruder disrupting my class, earning my teacher's
                    respect. But old habits die hard I breached a government server to see my exam results early. This
                    led to a visit from the Cybercell and my father burning all my gadgets. I had lost everything...
                    again.

                <p class="chapter-text">
                    Rebuilding from ashes, I joined a new tuition center for Computer Science. When I overheard they
                    needed a website, I stepped up. I built it, and at the launch, I was publicly recognized not as a
                    criminal, but as a genius. Destiny has a sense of humor the very girl who once called me worthless
                    sat in that audience, applauding me.

                <p class="chapter-text">
                    I continued to rise, winning state exhibitions and gaining government approval for my projects. I
                    ignored later attempts to reconnect from those who had dismissed me. I had moved past revenge.
