            <!-- Article Content -->
            <div class="article-body">
                <p class="article-lead">We spent 2023 and 2024 amazed that computers could write poetry and code. In
                    2025, the novelty of generation has worn off. The focus has shifted to 'Agency'—the ability of an AI
                    not just to talk, but to do.</p>

                <p>An Agentic AI differs from a Chatbot in its loop. A chatbot waits for input, processes it, and
                    outputs text. An agent has a goal. It breaks that goal into steps, executes actions using external
                    tools, observes the result, and iterates.</p>

                <h2>Tool Use: The Critical Breakthrough</h2>
                <p>Giving an LLM access to a calculator, a web browser, a Python REPL, or a bash terminal transforms it
                    from a philosopher into a worker. It can debug code by actually running it.</p>

                <p>We are seeing frameworks like LangChain and AutoGPT mature into reliable production systems. The
                    concept of 'Prompt Engineering' is being replaced by 'Flow Engineering'—designing the cognitive
                    architecture of the agent.</p>

                <h2>Multi-Agent Systems</h2>
                <p>Multi-Agent systems are the next frontier. Instead of one giant brain, we deploy a team: a Researcher
                    agent, a Coder agent, and a reviewer agent. They collaborate, critique each other, and produce
                    higher quality output than any single model.</p>

                <blockquote>"The J.A.R.V.I.S. M1 project I work on is a prime example. It uses a local vision-language
                    model to 'see' the screen and a shell executor to interact with the OS."</blockquote>

                <p>It can navigate menus and manage files without human intervention. Safety and alignment become
                    exponentially harder with agents. A chatbot that spews toxicity is bad; an agent that deletes your
                    production database because it hallucinated a command is catastrophic.</p>

                <h2>Safety & Economics</h2>
                <p>We are developing 'Constitutional AI' and strict sandbox environments to contain these agents. Every
                    tool call must be verified or run in a restricted scope.</p>

                <p>The economic impact will be profound. Agents don't just augment labor; they replace entire workflows.
                    Data entry, basic QA testing, and level-1 support are rapidly being fully automated.</p>

                <p>However, agents currently struggle with long-term planning and getting stuck in loops. They can be
                    fragile. A slight change in a website's UI can break a browsing agent completely.</p>

                <p>We are moving towards 'General Purpose Action Models.' Soon, you won't write a script to automate a
                    task; you will simply show the AI a video of you doing it once, and it will learn to replicate the
                    workflow.</p>
